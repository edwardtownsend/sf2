This repository contains the Python package and Jupyter Notebooks for the SF2 lab project in the Cambridge University Engineering department.

***Note that the new Python version of this lab is still in development. The notebooks are not a replacement for the PDF handouts.***

**It is possible that the notebooks will be updated midway through the course.**

## Installation

For this year, we recommend trying "Github codespaces", rather than running the code on your local machine.
These can be opened after logging in to github using the "code" dropdown above, and will save you some installation pain.

If you can't used codespaces for whatever reason, look at the [local installation instructions](https://github.com/sigproc/cued_sf2_lab/wiki/Local-installation-instructions).

## I need help!

Have a look at [the FAQ](https://github.com/sigproc/cued_sf2_lab/wiki/FAQ).
If this still doesn't help, call over a demonstrator!

## Note for demonstrators

This software consists of two repos, which share this README.

* https://github.com/sigproc/cued_sf2_lab
* https://github.com/sigproc/cued_sf2_lab-answers

If you are a student, you will only have access to the former!
If you are a demonstrator, you should request access to the latter.
The answers repository generates the other repository automatically.

More information for demonstrators can be found in [the demonstrator readme](https://github.com/sigproc/cued_sf2_lab-answers/blob/main/README-demonstrators.md).
